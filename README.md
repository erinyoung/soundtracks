# I know github is not really for blogging
but... I don't want to create a blog...

Below is a incomplete list of video game soundtracks that I think are great to listen to while I work. Mostly they lack vocals and can provide 3+ hours of background noise. `()` is indicative that I need to be in a certain mood to enjoy the OST.



Also, I want a place to save my list because sometimes I forget games when I redo my youtube playlist (youtube only allows 5000 songs per playlist)


TBA: WoW, sonic, fire emblem, kibry, mario, zelda, Donkey Kong (and the rest of the nintendo games), pokemon, xenoblade, assassins's creed, by year, and more
